This project contains helper classes which make it easy to support clustering for 
Apache James Mailbox (http://james.apache.org/mailbox) implementations. 

This is done by using hazelcast for all the distribution operations.

By using this classes it should be really straight forward to build an Apache James
Server cluster. (http://james.apache.org/server)
